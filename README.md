# ZED Unreal Plugin

This plugin gives you access to advanced Mixed Reality features to create immersive applications using the ZED.

## How to use

A modified version of the Unreal Engine is required to use this plugin, you can get all the setup instruction in the dedicated __[documentation](https://docs.stereolabs.com/mixed-reality/unreal/getting-started/)__.
